miRNA-encoded Peptides Prediction using Multi-source Feature Transformation and Ensemble Learning (mePTL)

mePTL firstly extracts features which contain domain knowledge from different biological elements, including sORFs and miPEPs, to obtain multi-source features. 

It then transforms the multi-source features using a feature representation learning framework. 

It applies the transformation features to train different machine learning models, and finally ensemble learning to fuse the models.
